a little backup setup for textfiles using git

I am cooking up a little git-based text file backup system that basically consists only of a local script and a remote git-hook.

Might not work for you. Hell, it might not even work for me. I'll tell you when I know. (*Update two years later: yes. It works for me. Better documentation to come*)

## SETUP

### SERVER

- `git init --bare txt.git`
- configure an email and a name for that repo. I, for one, use "server@tct.git" and "txt server"
- Copy contents of serverhooks/ to txt.git/hooks/ and make them executable or just set a symbolic link to there

### CLIENT
use clientScripts

## FAQ
### Has the name been autogenerated by github?
Yes.

## TODOs
- also push if local branch not the same as remote branch
- a little documentation about userScripts usage
- better documentation in general
